The folder contains the file for installing apps after a fresh installation of ubuntu or after a
crash of ubuntu happens. The file contains installation information of the following apps. Use "ctrl+c"
to cancel the installation at some point of time. Another advantage of this file is, one has to give
the password for installation only at the beginning. The file is written in shell script. 

Note: The file contains the information to install the apps which I use personally. Hence its better
to modify the file and add (or remove) the installation information for some of the apps accordingly.

Run the script:
    (i) sudo sh main.sh
